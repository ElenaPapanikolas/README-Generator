## Description
Are you tired of writing a README from scratch for all of your GitHub repositories? With the README Generator you don't have to! Simply answer a few questions about your project and a high-quality and polished README is created for you! This application generates the correct markdown syntax and plugs your answers into all the right places, for an easy to read and professional README. 

This challenge was a bit different than the last ones because it uses Node.js and is only seen through the terminal. If something doesn't work, you can't just open the console and see where you went wrong. It was a little tricky figuring out the correct syntax so everything looked good once the generated file was written. But once that was figured out, it went pretty fast.
